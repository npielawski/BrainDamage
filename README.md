# BrainDamage
This page contains most of the things I have been working on related to machine learning.

## Whoami?
I'm a French CS engineering student, currently in the final year of my studies.
I love machine learning and neural networks. I started to create some fully connected networks some years ago (really unefficiently) and nowadays I'm focusing on deepening my knowledge in more complex topics: deep learning, reinforcement learning and so on.

## What is this git repo about?
This repository contains most of the contests I have participated in on kaggle.com as well as some additional ideas I have developed (mainly tools and libraries).

I hope that you will find what you're looking for here, but if you have any questions
or suggestions, I'll be happy to discuss them with you.

Concerning the contents, you should definitely check out the INFOS.md file as it provides some really interesting links. In the kaggle folder, you can find the project files I have been
working on when competing on Kaggle. Finally, the tools folder contains several useful
tools I have created.

## Why this name for the repo?
While searching a name for this repo, I was listening to Pink Floyd's song brain damage:
[Pink Floyd - Brain Damage](https://open.spotify.com/track/1gNBKwi3t2K5HxbRp5Vose)
I finally decided to name this repo after this song, even though I'm trying to keep my own neural network sane ;)
