# BrainDamage
Machine Learning Concepts &amp; Contests

## Whoami?
I am a french student becoming a CS engineer, I love machine learning and
neural networks. I started creating some fully connected some years ago (really
unefficiently) and nowadays I am focusing on learning deeper and more complex
topics: deep learning, reinforcement learning and so on...

I hope that you are going to find what you look for and if you have any question
or suggestion, I'd be glad to talk about them with you!

## What is this git repo about?
This repo is for me a way to work on my projects and to share them throughout the
world. I hope it will also help me to get eventually hired.

About the content, you should definitely check the INFOS.md file that is containing
really interesting links. The kaggle folder contains the project files I have been
working with when competing on Kaggle and the tools folder contains several useful
tools I created.

## Why this name for the repo?
Because I love the following song from Pink Floyd:
[Pink Floyd - Brain Damage](https://open.spotify.com/track/1gNBKwi3t2K5HxbRp5Vose)
I was lacking of a proper name and I like the relation between this song
that I love and the neural networks that I love as well ;)
